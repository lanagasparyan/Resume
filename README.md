## Experience (10+ years)

### Machine Learning Engineer, Zillow (Zestimate), Remote (Sep 2021 -- Present)

- **Active Listing Comps Engine** (Apache Spark, Metaflow, H3 Geospatial)
    - Architected similar listings comparison engine powering Zillow Showcase's go-to-market strategy. Built scalable batch pipeline and real-time API using geospatial indexing (H3) and customizable ranking algorithms.
    - Impact: 30% listing wins, 75% engagement lift for Showcase - metrics used across sales, marketing, and investor communications

- **Interactive CMA & Realtime Valuation Platform** (Django, DocumentDB, PyTorch)
    - Architected 0-to-1 platform integrating real-time valuations, property embeddings, and amenity explanations. Designed APIs for comparative analysis and interactive agent reporting.
    - Impact: Foundation for new agent revenue products, establishing real-time ML serving patterns

- **Zestimate Infrastructure Modernization** (Terraform, AWS, Kubeflow, Metaflow, Docker)
    - Drove migration of critical ML pipelines from legacy systems to containerized infrastructure. Established CI/CD patterns, monitoring standards, and deployment practices that reduced operational overhead.
    - Impact: $500K annual savings, 80% faster deployments, 95% reduction in on-call alerts through proactive monitoring

- **Next-Gen Explainability: Amenity Adjustment & LLM Tools** (PyTorch, DeepLift, LangChain)
    - Developing ML explainability service for dollar-value feature attributions and LLM tools for automated Zestimate queries. Building APIs for property data retrieval, comparative analysis, and natural language explanations.
    - Impact: Foundation for automated customer support and transparent valuations

- **Engineering Excellence & Pipeline Stability**
    - Established MR best practices (stacked MRs, pre-submission checklists) and documentation standards. Led weekly bug bashes targeting low-effort, high-impact improvements.
    - Impact: Improved Zestimate pipeline success rate from 75% to 85%, reducing production incidents

### Machine Learning Engineer, OkCupid (Match.com), New York City (May 2020 - Sep 2021)

- **Discount Optimization** (Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Weights and Biases)
    - Led efforts to optimize subscription pricing (discounts) to maximize revenue for OkCupid. Implemented end-to-end ML pipelines, feature engineering, modeling, alerting, etc.
    - Impact: Increased overall revenue by 6% through A/B testing against assigned prices

### Machine Learning Engineer, FactSet, New York City (Apr 2015 - May 2020)

- **ML-Powered Financial Data Extraction** (Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Sagemaker)
    - Led multiple ML initiatives: (1) Speaker identification system for earnings calls using spectrograms and CNNs, (2) Private company fact extraction from 1.6M websites using ELMo/BiLSTM. Built end-to-end pipelines from data collection to deployment.
    - Impact: 20% reduction in human-hours for earnings call processing, automated extraction from millions of documents

- **Financial Document Search & Ranking Systems** (Apache Spark, Java, Python)
    - Architected search infrastructure: (1) Type-ahead and query expansion for document search, (2) Real-time formula ranking using language models, (3) Duplicate document detection service. Scaled to handle thousands of queries/documents per day.
    - Impact: Improved formula ranking from 5.6 to 2.3, 66% faster document processing, powered StreetAccount trending news

### ML Research Engineer, Tata Research Development and Design Centre, India (July 2011 - July 2013)

- **Event Detection in Time Series** (Java, Python, RapidMiner)
    - Wrote an algorithm based on Shape Context for finding frequently occurring patterns and events, with as good results as SAX, DTW etc. with 7% better results in the particular domain of car sensors.

- **Data Harmonization Framework (DHF)** (Java, Apache Pig)
    - Implemented an ETL framework that exploits the power of map-reduce and big-databases to fuse incongruous enterprise data from disparate sources in near real time.
